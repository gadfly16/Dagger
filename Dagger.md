# Dagger

Dagger is a computing system designed as a coherent, self-describing integrated development environment for computational problem-solving. It unifies data representation, code execution, and user interface into a single conceptual framework.

## Core Concepts

Dagger is built on a minimal but sufficient set of foundational concepts:

- Memory Model
- Type System (Constraints and Interpretations)
- Serialization
- Concurrency Model
- Caching and Cost
- Runtime Model
- User Interface

### The Tree

The fundamental memory model in Dagger is a labeled tree of nodes. Everything in the system—data, code, and metadata—exists within this unified structure. The tree serves as both the storage and computational model.

There are four primary node types:
- **Trees**: Can have both metadata and children
- **Numbers**: Have metadata but no children, representing atomic values
- **References**: Ordered lists pointing to other nodes within the tree
  - Can contain **Numbers** (pointing to the Nth element of a tree)
  - Can contain **Names** (pointing to nodes labeled with that name)
- **Names**: Human readable reference to a node in the given scope

This unified representation allows consistent access patterns across the system while providing both positional and named access to tree elements. The reference mechanism enables construction of complex data structures, including directed acyclic graphs.

### Constraints and Interpretations

Rather than traditional types, Dagger uses constraints and interpretations defined in node metadata:

- **Constraints** limit the valid values or structures (e.g., restricting a number to int8 range)
- **Interpretations** define how to understand a tree (e.g., as a string, image, or function)

Numbers are represented as arbitrary-precision floating point values by default, with constraints allowing optimization. The system defines a default precision to prevent infinite calculations while allowing precision to be explicitly specified where needed.

### Serialization

Dagger provides a standard serialization mechanism for both storage and communication. The serialized form preserves both values and metadata (including constraints and interpretations), enabling perfect reconstruction of the tree after serialization.

### Concurrency Model

Concurrency in Dagger is managed through atomicity constraints on nodes:

- Nodes can be marked as **atomic**, triggering synchronization mechanisms when accessed
- The system guarantees to present the tree only in its **last known complete state**
- Transformations can make copies of atomic subtrees, process them in the background, and swap nodes only when processing is complete
- Based on DAG analysis, synchronization code can be omitted when no concurrent access is detected

This approach integrates concurrency control directly into the data model, allowing for the construction of higher-level concurrency primitives (like channels) while maintaining the unified system model.

### Caching and Cost

The system uses the concept of "cost" to manage computational resources:

- **Measurements**: Nodes with infinite cost, impossible to reproduce (like input data or generic code)
- **Results**: Nodes with finite cost that can be reproduced through computation

This distinction enables intelligent memory management, where the system can free results with low reproduction cost when needed, recreating them on demand while preserving the logical tree structure.

### Runtime Model

Program code is stored as trees interpreted as abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Functions can execute concurrently in lightweight threads similar to goroutines. The system can present and edit these ASTs in various forms (textual or graphical) while maintaining the underlying tree structure.

Because code and data share the same representation, code can be manipulated programmatically just like data. The runtime environment integrates the compiler, allowing for targeted optimizations based on precise knowledge of data constraints and structure.

When possible, the system generates optimized code paths based on the specific constraints present in the data being processed. This enables both high-level abstraction and efficient execution.

### User Interface

Dagger functions as a fully integrated development environment where data, code, storage, compiler, and editor form a coherent whole. The UI becomes universal—adding domain-specific functions transforms the environment into a specialized application for that domain.

The interface can present trees differently based on their interpretation (as code, images, or other data types), while maintaining the unified underlying representation.

## Implementation Strategy

Dagger aims to get as close to hardware as possible, particularly for leveraging modern hybrid computing architectures (CPUs, GPUs). Implementation requires significant foundational work:

1. Establishing the tree-based memory model with all node types
2. Building serialization systems
3. Creating text representation and parsing for ASTs
4. Implementing the runtime environment with concurrency support
5. Developing the integrated user interface

The development approach focuses first on proving the concept's viability before moving to a self-hosting system.

## Core Principles

- **Unification**: Data and code share the same fundamental representation
- **Constraint-based optimization**: Generate efficient implementations based on declared constraints
- **Hardware awareness**: Leverage appropriate computational resources based on structure and operations
- **Integrated concurrency**: Embed synchronization mechanisms within the data model itself
- **Integrated environment**: Eliminate artificial boundaries between development tools and applications

Dagger reimagines computing as a coherent environment where the distinction between using a computer and programming it dissolves, creating a system exactly as complex as it needs to be.
